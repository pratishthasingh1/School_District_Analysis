# School District Analysis
##Purpose
A school board revealed that a file (students_complete.csv) showed evidence of academic dishonesty in the 9th grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School. 
An analysis was done to see the full extent of this academic dishonesty. To perform the analysis, the 9th grade values were nulled to see how the district summary would be affected. 

##Results
###How is the district summary affected?
When the 9th grade values are nulled, district summary shows Thomas High School to show approximately 65% passing rate. This is because the values for 9th graders are still being counted, but they are counted as 0, bringing the overall grades of the school down. 

###How is the school summary affected?
When the grades 10-12 are only being analyzed, the percentage increases to almost 91%. This is because 9th graders are not being counted in the total for the new analysis.

###How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Thomas High School did better compared to other schools when ninth graders's overall passing grades were included into the analysis.
